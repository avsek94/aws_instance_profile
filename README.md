# aws_instance_profile
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provide the ability to grant instances temporary credentials. These temporary credentials can then be used by hosted applications to access permissions configured within the role. IAM roles eliminate the need for managing credentials, help mitigate long-term security risks, and simplify permissions management. Prerequisites for this lab include understanding how to log in to and use the AWS Management Console, EC2 basics (including how to launch an instance), IAM basics (including users, policies, and roles), and how to use the AWS CLI. Note: When connecting to the Bastion and the web server, do so independently of each other. The Bastion is used for interacting with AWS services via the CLI.
